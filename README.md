# Implementing Innovation: A User's Manual for Open Government Programs


This guide draws from [Reboot's](http://reboot.org) experience around the world helping government reformers achieve real change. It is a practical resource for anyone working to implement an open government initiative, whether they are inside government or outside supporters.

This web version of the report is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Setup

Should you want to get this running locally on your own machine clone the repository. Install Jekyll if necessary: `gem install bundler jekyll`. Then navigate to the repo's direction and run `bundle install`.

For detailed directions on how to build and serve a Jekyll site see [their documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/), running `jekyll serve --baseurl ''` should kick things off.
