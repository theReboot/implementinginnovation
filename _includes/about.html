                <p>​Implementing Innovation: A User’s Manual for Open Government Programs_​ is a hands-on resource that provides practical advice and guidance for government changemakers as they navigate the specific challenges of implementing innovative programs in the public sector.</p>
                <p>Through ongoing engagement with the open government community and a year-long collaboration with Mexico’s Digital Strategy Unit, Reboot has witnessed firsthand the remarkable dedication of individuals working to realize the ideals of transparency, accountability, and participation within their governments. Yet we have also observed a scarcity of resources to support these reformers in the hard work of program design and execution. This manual responds to that widespread need.</p>
