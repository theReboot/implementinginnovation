		<p><em>Implementing Innovation: A Userâ€™s Manual for Open Government Programs</em> provides practical guidance for public sector changemakers around the world. Through ongoing engagement with the global open government community and a year-long collaboration with the Government of Mexico, Reboot observed the remarkable dedication of individuals working to realize the ideals of transparency, accountability, and participation in their countries. Yet there are limited resources to support these reformers in the hard work of program design and execution. This manual responds to that widespread need.</p>
