	<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
	<p>​This manual would not have been possible without the support and insights provided by a great number of people, whose willingness to share their experiences working on innovative open government programs is a powerful demonstration of our shared ideal of transparency.</p>

	<p>Reboot is especially grateful to Coordinación de Estrategia Digital Nacional (CEDN), the digital strategy unit within the Office of the President of Mexico, which provided us access to the implementation of several pilot programs, and the opportunity to learn directly from people working on the frontlines of public sector innovation. We would like to thank Alejandra Lagunes, Guillermo Ruiz de Teresa, Ania Calderón, Alejandra Ruiz del Río, Jorge Soto, Enrique Zapata, Rodolfo Wilhelmy, Eduardo Clark, Pablo Villarreal, Mariana Courtney, Eduardo Vargas, Jorge Díaz, and the rest of the team for their openness and candor in sharing their experience and reflecting on their portfolio. CEDN was forward-looking enough to invite Reboot to closely accompany the implementation of one of their most significant programs, Agentes de Innovación (or Innovation Agents), an open government and civic innovation fellowship. We would also like to thank especially the participants of that program, including José Manuel Azpiroz, Natalia Briseño, Adrián Carrillo, Tania Castillo, Moís Cherem, Boris Cuapio, Eduardo Garza, Alejandro González, Leticia Jáuregui, Patrick Kane, Aura Martínez, Marcela Nieto, Clare Nowakowski, Santiago Ocejo, Hugo Osorio, Lorena Rivero, Alberto Saracho, Xiuh Tenorio, and Abelardo Vidarrueta. To the many citizens, service providers, and government officials who graciously gave their time to participate in interviews, observation, design research, and product testing, we also offer our gratitude.</p> 

	<p>We gratefully acknowledge the generous support we received from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to undertake this work. Thank you to the team at the Hewlett Foundation, including Libby Haight, Ruth Levine, Lourdes Robles, and Denise Robichau for their thought partnership as well as financial support, without which this unique manual would not have been possible. Laura Bacon of the Omidyar Network was also a key thought partner as Reboot’s role in this project was shaped. We would also like to thank David Sasaki for his guidance and inspiration in early conversations regarding this work.</p> 

	<p>Throughout the project, two other key partners accompanied the implementation of the Innovation Agents program. We would like to thank the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE) and Public Works of Stanford University for their flexibility and communication. Thank you especially to Guillermo Cejudo, Mauricio Dussauge, Cynthia Michel, and Jenny Stefanotti.</p> 

	<p>The authors were fortunate to have the opportunity to share early findings and content from this manual with members of the open government regional community through participation in the 2015 Open Government Partnership (OGP) European Meeting. Thank you to the members of the OGP Support Unit, the Government of Georgia for hosting us, and to the OGP Points of Contact who attended and actively participated in our workshop.</p>
