	<h1>About the Manual</h1>
	<p>​<em>Implementing Innovation: A User’s Manual for Open Government Programs</em> is a hands-on resource that provides practical advice and guidance for government changemakers as they navigate the specific challenges of implementing innovative programs in the public sector.</p>
	<p>Through ongoing engagement with the open government community and a <a target="_blank" href="http://reboot.org/case-studies/developmental-evaluation-for-public-sector-innovation-mexico/">year-long collaboration with Mexico’s Digital Strategy Unit</a>, Reboot has witnessed firsthand the remarkable dedication of individuals working to realize the ideals of transparency, accountability, and participation within their governments. Yet we have also observed a scarcity of resources to support these reformers in the hard work of program design and execution. This manual responds to that widespread need.</p>

	<h1>About Reboot</h1>
	<p>​Reboot is a social impact firm dedicated to inclusive development and accountable governance. We help governments, foundations, and international organizations achieve their missions. We think of this as working toward a 21st century social contract.</p>

	<p>The foundation of governing legitimacy and collective prosperity, a social contract is inclusive by definition. While the ability to access information, organize, and input has reshaped the scope of inclusivity in governance, few institutions have kept pace with these changes. Our social contract is due for renegotiation.</p>

	<p>Reboot is working at the forefront of these transitions. We help our clients explore the origins of complex issues, design contextually appropriate interventions, bring these ideas to reality, and evaluate the results along the way. We approach the task with a set of underlying principles that cut across each engagement: immersion, collaboration, and iteration.</p>

	<p>The possibilities for inclusive development and accountable governance—for a 21st century social contract—are growing. From supporting good governance in Nigeria to human development in Nicaragua to civic innovation in the United States and beyond, we are working to realize them.</p>

	<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
	<p>​This manual would not have been possible without the support and insights provided by a great number of people, whose willingness to share their experiences working on innovative open government programs is a powerful demonstration of our shared ideal of transparency.</p>

	<p>Reboot is especially grateful to Coordinación de Estrategia Digital Nacional (CEDN), the digital strategy unit within the Office of the President of Mexico, which provided us access to the implementation of several pilot programs, and the opportunity to learn directly from people working on the frontlines of public sector innovation. We would like to thank Alejandra Lagunes, Guillermo Ruiz de Teresa, Ania Calderón, Alejandra Ruiz del Río, Jorge Soto, Enrique Zapata, Rodolfo Wilhelmy, Eduardo Clark, Pablo Villarreal, Mariana Courtney, Eduardo Vargas, Jorge Díaz, and the rest of the team for their openness and candor in sharing their experience and reflecting on their portfolio. CEDN was forward-looking enough to invite Reboot to closely accompany the implementation of one of their most significant programs, Agentes de Innovación (or Innovation Agents), an open government and civic innovation fellowship. We would also like to thank especially the participants of that program, including José Manuel Azpiroz, Natalia Briseño, Adrián Carrillo, Tania Castillo, Moís Cherem, Boris Cuapio, Eduardo Garza, Alejandro González, Leticia Jáuregui, Patrick Kane, Aura Martínez, Marcela Nieto, Clare Nowakowski, Santiago Ocejo, Hugo Osorio, Lorena Rivero, Alberto Saracho, Xiuh Tenorio, and Abelardo Vidarrueta. To the many citizens, service providers, and government officials who graciously gave their time to participate in interviews, observation, design research, and product testing, we also offer our gratitude.</p> 

	<p>We gratefully acknowledge the generous support we received from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to undertake this work. Thank you to the team at the Hewlett Foundation, including Libby Haight, Ruth Levine, Lourdes Robles, and Denise Robichau for their thought partnership as well as financial support, without which this unique manual would not have been possible. Laura Bacon of the Omidyar Network was also a key thought partner as Reboot’s role in this project was shaped. We would also like to thank David Sasaki for his guidance and inspiration in early conversations regarding this work.</p> 

	<p>Throughout the project, two other key partners accompanied the implementation of the Innovation Agents program. We would like to thank the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE) and Public Works of Stanford University for their flexibility and communication. Thank you especially to Guillermo Cejudo, Mauricio Dussauge, Cynthia Michel, and Jenny Stefanotti.</p> 

	<p>The authors were fortunate to have the opportunity to share early findings and content from this manual with members of the open government regional community through participation in the 2015 Open Government Partnership (OGP) European Meeting. Thank you to the members of the OGP Support Unit, the Government of Georgia for hosting us, and to the OGP Points of Contact who attended and actively participated in our workshop.</p>
