	<h1>Sample Theory of Change</h1>
	<p>This is an abridged version of the Innovation Agents programâ€™s theory of change. It has been streamlined and shortened for easy reference, and is presented as a real-world example, not necessarily an ideal model. We have provided notes for each section to help you get started on your own.</p>
